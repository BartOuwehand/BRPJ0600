CALIB-J0600-2020.csv : list of 5 reference stars (UCAC4 name of each star, catalog Mag and position on the CCD) used to get the calibrated the light curve of j0600.
J0600-2020_ASTEP-ANTARCTICA_Rc_field.png : Image field with CCD positions of the target (T1) and reference stars (C1 to C5)
J0600-2020_ASTEP-ANTARCTICA_Rc_measurements.csv : Target calibrated light curve
J0600-2020_ASTEP-ANTARCTICA_Rc_rawlc.csv : Target and photometric fluxes of reference stars
J0600-2020_ASTEP.png : Target light curve plot
J0600-2020_comp-stars.png : reference light curves plot

These data should allows you to match our observations with yours.
